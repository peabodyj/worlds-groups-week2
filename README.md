# worlds-groups-week2
Follow along as your favorite teams play their Week 2 games to see who will make it out of group stages!

------

League of Legends hosts a Worlds competition every year around October where the best teams around the world compete in one of the biggest eSports tournaments of the year. The tournament is broken up into a group stage and a bracket stage. During group stage, the teams are broken up into 4 pools of 4 teams each. The teams play round robin within their groups for two weeks and the top 2 teams from each pool will move on into the playoff bracket.

Thats where this webpage comes in handy. During Week 2, all the matchups will be preset. Since only the top 2 teams will make it out of groups this website will help show you the scenarios for how your favorite team can make it out. Follow along as the teams play, click on the outcome of the Week 2 match, and see each team's chances of making it out of the group stage.

But really this is just a fun little project I am working on to become more familiar with ReactJS and Redux. It is a work-in-progress, and I still have a few hours of work to put into this before it is complete.

### Screenshot
This is what it currently looks like. Users can select the matchup (shown in bold), the colored bubbles will eventually show up at the bottom. A user would then be able to hover over the bubble and a tooltip will show what outcomes are needed for a team to make it out of group stage.
